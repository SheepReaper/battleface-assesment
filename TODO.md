# Notes

Per the Requirement/Challenge doc. They wanted the response to the POST /quotation to be a certain schema. I assure you, It's fully compliant (check in dev-tools) but the app is set up to redirect back to the list of Quotes after creating a new one so you never get to see it.

# Afterthoughts

Upon request, I can re-do this project in my preferred frameworks:

- .NET 5 (api server) + Vue front-end
- Or do the whole thing in Nuxt (express)
- Or maybe even python api server + Vue

I guess it really just comes down to which styling frameworks are supported by which JavaScript framewroks.

In this order:

1. Vuetify
2. Bulma
3. Bootstrap
